# Front End Task - Take Home

This is my submission for the Take Home Task for my application.

I've set it up as a HTML file so it can be opened and viewed instantly, due to this being a front-end role, though normally I would split it into modular PHP files for things like the header, footer etc.

Total time from planning through testing and completion is 13 hours. (This timing isn't perfectly strict/exact, but is approximately correct).
